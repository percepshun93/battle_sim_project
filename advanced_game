Advanced Game

Combat is very simple in the original game, as such an improved version of the combat was implemented using the following rules:
  1. In the cases where a unit would win, it instead deals its damage before the other unit is able to deal theirs. 
    Soldiers hit Knights first, 
    Archers hit Soldiers first, and
    Knights hit Archers first.

  2. Knights are able to trample other units. If the Knight is fighting an Archer and the unit behind the Archer is another Archer, then        the Knight deals its damage to
     both Archers.

  3. If an Archer is at the front of its army but not in battle, they deal their damage to the opposing unit if they are still alive at        the end of combat.
  
  An additional feature that was also implemented was the role of medics:
  Money remaining after the purchasing of armies will be used to hire and outfit medics. When a unit dies, it will be returned to the pool   at the back of the army. Each time this happens, supplies for the medics decreases. Once the medics have no supplies left,
  they will be unable to save any more units.
  Medics are hired and supplied at $1 per unit. All money at the end of army creation is spent on Medics.
